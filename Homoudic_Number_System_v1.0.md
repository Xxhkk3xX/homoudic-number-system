# Homoudic Number System — Version 1.0  
**Author:** Homoud Al Kabi  
**Date:** March 22, 2025  

This document defines the original version of the **Homoudic Number System**, a custom mathematical framework that redefines division by zero using a symbolic unit `j`, where:

> j = 1 / 0  
> j * 0 = 1  
> 0j = 1  

This version contains all core definitions, arithmetic rules, and power rules as originally conceived.  
**This file is final and must never be modified. Future changes should be made in versioned updates (v1.1, v2.0, etc.)**

---

## Core Definitions  
**1.** `j = 1 / 0`  
**2.** `j * 0 = 1`  
**3.** `0j = 1`  
**4.** `a / 0 = aj` for any real number `a`  
**5.** `aj * 0 = a`  
**6.** `0 / 0 = 0j = 1`

---

## Arithmetic Rules  
**7.** `j + j = 2j`  
**8.** `aj + bj = (a + b)j`  
**9.** `1 / j = 0`  
**10.** `j / j = 1`  
**11.** `j - j = 0`

---

## Power Rules  
**12.** `j^n = j` for all integers `n ≥ 1`  
**13.** `a * j^n = a^n * j` for all integers `n ≥ 1`  
  Examples:  
  - `5j^2 = 25j`  
  - `2j^3 = 8j`  
**14.** `j^0 = 1`  
**15.** `0^0 = 1`

## Notes

- This number system breaks the traditional zero-product rule (e.g., `j * 0 = 1`)
- Powers of `j` are idempotent for all integers `n ≥ 1`: `j^n = j`
- `j^0 = 1` is separately defined and consistent within the system
- All operations are consistent within the system’s own logic
- Inspired by the historical introduction of imaginary numbers (`i = √-1`)
