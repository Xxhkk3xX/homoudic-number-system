# Homoudic Number System

A custom mathematical framework redefining division by zero using a new symbolic unit `j`, where:

> j = 1 / 0  
> j * 0 = 1  
> 0j = 1

This system was created by **Homoud Al Kabi** in 2025 to explore new algebraic behavior beyond the limits of standard arithmetic.

## Core Concepts

The Homoudic Number System introduces new rules to allow division by zero in a consistent, self-contained way. The rules are:

### Core Definitions
1. `j = 1 / 0`  
2. `j * 0 = 1`  
3. `0j = 1`  
4. `a / 0 = aj` for any real number `a`  
5. `aj * 0 = a`  
6. `0 / 0 = 0j = 1`

---

### Arithmetic Rules
7. `j + j = 2j`  
8. `aj + bj = (a + b)j`  
9. `1 / j = 0`  
10. `j / j = 1`  
11. `j - j = 0`

---

### Power Rules
12. `j^n = j` for all integers `n ≥ 1`  
13. `a * j^n = a^n * j` for all integers `n ≥ 1`  
  Examples:  
  - `5j^2 = 25j`  
  - `2j^3 = 8j`  
14. `j^0 = 1`  
15. `0^0 = 1`

## Purpose

This system is not meant to replace standard mathematics, but to experiment with the idea of redefining "undefined" operations in a logically consistent way. It is inspired by how imaginary numbers (`i = √-1`) were once controversial but are now fundamental.
